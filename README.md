# RESTAssuredSelfStudy

This repository contains the classes that I have created when I was learing Rest Assured.

It contains GET, POST, PUT, PATCH requests I have created in BDD style (Gherkins).

Folder structure
================
com.api.test-> Initial rest APIs were pointed to "https://reqres.in/" which is a fake API hosted in web.
com..api.test.server.local -> Here I've hosted a local JSON server and pointed the request to that server which was hosted in http://localhost:3000/
